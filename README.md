# `@ubiquity-os/personal-agent-bridge`

Personal Agent Bridge is an UbiquityOS plugin that facilitates communication between UbiquityOS and a Personal Agent hosted by a user's Github account. It picks up any comment that starts with `/@username` and forwards it to personal-agent of the mentioned user for further processing. What happens at the personal-agent is documented [here](https://github.com/EresDevOrg/personal-agent/blob/development/README.md).
